# State and Events

## Learning Goals

- Declaring State
- Altering State with an Event
- Array States

## Getting Started

Begin by running:

```

followed by

```
npm start
```

## Workshop Deliverables

1. When someone clicks on the `DaysCounter` button, the number of days decreases. It will not decrease below 0.

2. When someone clicks the `buy` button in the `SupplyCard`, it toggles a state that either applies or removes the `strikethrough` class to the span inside the card. Additionally, the button changes text between 'Buy' and 'Complete'.
